# CyberCAN
CyberCAN: a benchmark simulator designed to simulate IVN traffic for vehicle operations using a real-world validated heavy-duty truck model.

CyberCAN is currently undergoing the process of Licensing. If interested to get a copy of the tool, please contact the development team for further details. Thank you.

Version 1 "CyberCAN: In-Vehicle Network and Attack Simulator"

This work introduces CyberCAN, a benchmark simulator designed to simulate IVN traffic for vehicle operations using a real-world 
validated heavy-duty truck model. CyberCAN supports the J1939 CAN protocol and is flexible to be adapted for other
vehicle models as well. In addition to simulating normal driving conditions, it also simulates vehicle behavior under different
adversarial attacks on the vehicle network such as Denial of Service (DoS), Fuzzing, Replay, Plateau and Spoofing attacks.
CyberCAN also logs the network traffic under both normal and attack conditions in CAN format 
where the CAN logs are validated against actual truck data to ensure accuracy and reliability. The generated datasets from
CyberCAN offer valuable resources for developing and testing more resilient control and defence mechanisms, contributing
significantly to the safety and cybersecurity of automotive systems.
